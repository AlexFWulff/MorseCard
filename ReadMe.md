# MorseCard: The Tiny Morse Code Interpreter and Telegraph Basestation
## About this repository
In this repository you can find a variety of different sketches that will run on my MorseCard. If you're new to Morse Code you can try out ```Trainer.ino```, a sketch which allows you to learn the various morse code signals. ```Trainer.ino``` also allows you to connect with other MorseCards via a speaker cable to send messages like a telegraph. ```Quiz.ino``` will give you a letter to signal out and check if you are correct.
<br><br>
For more advanced users, ```Advanced.ino``` exists. It will try its best to convert Morse Code into text, automatically recognizing spaces between letters and words. This mode also supports inter-card communication via a speaker cable.
<br><br>

You can check out the build instructions on <a href="">Hackster</a>. Fork this repository and create some sketches of your own!
